## Overview

This provides a base Drupal site that can function within [GitPod](https://gitpod.io).

## Current Issues

1. Needs to have an admin user that can be reinstalled each time, separate from the default admin that always gets a different password.
1. Olivero theme won't install at all, citing a missing block.

## Default Admin User
Username: drupal_admin
Password: ZNB*ufm1tyz4rwc@yzk
